# Python App Exercise

## Exercise
- Use the ApiService to fetch TODOs from an API and save them into the _storage_ folder
    - TODOs can be accessed from this URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/
    - Each TODO should be saved on a single file in CSV format
    - The filename must contain the TODO "id" prefixed with the current date.
        - Example: 2021_04_28_123.csv


## Extra points
- Use _requests_ library from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

## Warning
I was not able to upload files to the test's github (https://github.com/rogervila/python-app-exercise), neither to fork from there, so I uploaded it here.
